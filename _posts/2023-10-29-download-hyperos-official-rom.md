Xiaomi has announced HyperOS this week (October 2023), and many of people want to try the new UI as soon as possible. But as you know, Xiaomi always release the new updates for the China first, and they are no longer providing download links on their official website.

So, like we did with MIUI 14, we will be providing updates links updated daily, in order to provide firmware updates for custom ROMs users through XiaomiFirmwareUpdater project. The new download page on XiaomiFirmwareUpdater website will have all HyperOS official ROMs, including stable and China beta starting from October 2024 for all eligible devices. We'll keep it updated with newer releases every day.
