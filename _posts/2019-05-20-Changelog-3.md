It has been a long time since the last changelog post, so many things happened from April to today. Let's start:

<hr/>

### Packet Sponsorship
XM Firmware Updater is now powered by Packet cloud servers! You may have noticed the increased speed of releasing new firmware files. More details available [here](https://xmfirmwareupdater.com/2019/05/15/packet.html) and thanks again to Packet for their open-source support initiative!

### MIUI ARB Checker
A few days ago, I started working on a simple command-line tool to check Anti-Rollback Index in MIUI Recovery and Fastboot ROMs. And as usual, it's written in python3, means it works on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.

Check the new tool [here](https://xmfirmwareupdater.com/projects/miui-arb-checker/). and feel free to contribute to the [code](https://github.com/XiaomiFirmwareUpdater/miui_arb_checker).

### Telegram Chat Bot
Another project I've been working on since the beginning of May. "Uranus" chatbot is an all-in-one bot that provides useful services for Xiaomi users, based on XM Firmware Updater various projects like MIUI Tracker, Firmware Updater, etc.

Currently, the bot is available on Telegram only, but I plan to add more platforms later.

You can start using it [here](https://t.me/XiaomiGeeksBot), but don't forget to check usage instructions [here](https://xmfirmwareupdater.com/projects/uranus-chatbot/#usage).

The source code of this bot is available on GitHub [repo](https://github.com/XiaomiFirmwareUpdater/xiaomi_uranus_tgbot), contributions are more than welcome!
