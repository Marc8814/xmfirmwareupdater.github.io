categories: Changelogs

Welcome to XM Firmware Updater's quick post, where we go over changes in the last weeks and announce some updates about next steps.

XM Firmware Updater is entering the 60th week now, thanks for our all supporters.

The major change that happened this week is the announcement about firmware-less packages. I made a [poll](https://t.me/XiaomiFirmwareUpdater/3292) on our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/XiaomiFirmwareUpdater) asking if there's any need to provide firmware-less MIUI packages for devices with ARB because its downloads number is really small and it's taking much space for nothing.
And as numbers say, most of the users *65%* said they don't use it so, I posted this announcement on [XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=79176402&postcount=512) and removed all firmware-less files from the server:

> After providing more than 230 firmware-less packages since last August, I officially announced that XMFirmwareUpdater will [no longer](https://github.com/XiaomiFirmwareUpdater/mi-firmware-updater/commit/904f93207ae4cf8a20fb3157a6e240d527ff020c) provide firmware-less builds for whyred, wayne, nitrogen and sakura.
Meanwhile, you can still make your own builds from official MIUI zip files using XM Firmware Creator tool. Check more [here](https://xmfirmwareupdater.com/projects/xiaomi-flashable-firmware-creator/).
