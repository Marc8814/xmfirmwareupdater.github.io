categories: ROMs

Xiaomi has announced MIUI 14 one week ago (December 2022), and many of people wants to try the new UI as soon as possible. But as you know, Xiaomi always release the new updates for the China first, and they are no longer providing download links on their official website.

So, like we did with MIUI 13, we will be providing updates links updated daily, in order to provide firmware updates for custom ROMs users through XMFirmwareUpdater project. The new download page on XMFirmwareUpdater website will have all MIUI 14 official ROMs, including stable and China beta starting from December  for all eligible devices. We'll keep it updated with newer releases every day.
