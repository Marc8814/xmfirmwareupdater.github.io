title: Announcing XM Firmware Updater website V1!
categories: Updates
---

The new website is now online, completely re-written from scratch.

XM Firmware Updater website since the creation of it had some *minor issues* like homepage table loading and mobile view compatibility.

Fortunately, I have got a good time to work on the website update, and this time I recreated it from scratch. However, I've used the same template as before to keep the familiar look and feel.

**Here's what's new:**

* Complete re-created from scratch using HTML 5, CSS 3, JS, Jekyll, and Bootstrap.
* Cleaned home page, no more tables. There's a select box where you can choose download type and device.
* Support for downloading Firmware, MIUI ROMs, and Vendor packages (thanks to [mi-vendor-updater](https://github.com/TryHardDood/mi-vendor-updater/)).
* With this update, every device will have its download page, no more conflicts.
* New archive pages for all downloads types, you can access it from device latest downloads page.
* RSS feeds for releases and new posts, check [RSS](/rss/).
* Better navigation bar in PC view and mobile view as well.
* New pages for downloading latest [firmware](/firmware/), [vendor](/vendor/), and [MIUI](/miui/) releases.
* New pages for checking [supported devices](/supported/).
* Blog: new pages for [archive](/blog/archive/) and [categories](/blog/categories/).
