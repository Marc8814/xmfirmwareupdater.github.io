XM Firmware Updater is a community project, started in January 2018, aims to provide firmware packages for all XM devices, in order to allow custom ROM users to update their devices' firmware easily through custom recovery instead of having to flash full ROM every time they want to update.

Our project has been covered by some of the most popular tech websites and forums in the world, including [XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-firmware-updater-tool-miui-roms/), [4PDA](https://4pda.ru/2018/01/31/349457/), [Android Community](https://androidcommunity.com/xiaomi-firmware-updater-provides-updated-firmware-for-most-xiaomi-devices-20180130/), [Piunika Web](https://piunikaweb.com/2019/01/16/xiaomi-user-waiting-for-updates-this-new-site-will-help/), [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/blog/projects-week-november-5-2018/), [GizChina](https://en.gizchina.it/2018/01/xiaomi-firmware-updater-help-custom-rom/), and many other websites.

Using various Python and shell scripts, an automated process runs on Linux server every six hours and extracts firmware from MIUI official ROMs, both Global and China, and uploads it to hosting servers.

The project is not affiliated with Xiaomi Inc. or MIUI ROM Development Team.

This is a standalone community driven project made for Custom ROMs users on XDA, founded and led by [yshalsager](https://github.com/yshalsager).

XM Firmware Updater is an open-source project, we welcome any contributions. You can head to the sources at [GitHub](https://github.com/XiaomiFirmwareUpdater).

Also, do mind that this project requires a lot of efforts, sleepless nights and strenuous perseverance. XM Firmware Updater scripts are automated, running on a Linux server and files are hosted on other servers.
