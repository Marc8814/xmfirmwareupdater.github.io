#### Do you want to create your own firmware files from MIUI ROMs without depending on XM Firmware Updater? Then you need the new script!

XM Flashable Firmware Creator is a tool that generates flashable firmware-update packages from official (or non official) MIUI ROMS.

It supports creating untouched firmware, non-arb firmware, firmware + vendor flashable zip, and firmware-less ROMs from any supported local or remote miui zip. You just need to give the tool a local file path or a direct link to the miui zip and it'll do the job for you!
